        <p>
          Radiance is a web framework for Common Lisp with a focus on allowing you to run multiple applications together. However, it can be just as easily used for any kind of web-focused project.

          If you're interested in using Radiance to develop your own applications, you will need a capable Common Lisp implementation and <a href="https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/">Quicklisp</a>. Installing Radiance requires adding a separate dist to Quicklisp, but remains nonetheless rather straight-forward:
        </p>
        <code class="block">
(<span class="func">ql-dist:install-dist</span> <span class="string">"http://dist.tymoon.eu/shirakumo.txt"</span>)<br/>
(<span class="func">ql:quickload</span> <span class="keyword">:radiance</span>)
        </code>
        <p>
          From there on out you can continue by reading through <a href="https://shirakumo.github.io/radiance/">Radiance's documentation</a> or jumping straight in with an <a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/radiance-tutorial/blob/master/Part%200.md">in-depth tutorial</a> that walks you through all the steps of creating a fully-fledged web application.
        </p>

          <h2><a href="#deploy">Deploying an Existing Application</a></h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          If you are instead interested in deploying an existing application that uses Radiance on one of your servers, you can take a short-cut that doesn't require you to set up a development environment. You can use Radiance's automatic bootstrapper to easily create a working setup. All you'll need is a capable Common Lisp implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Linux using SBCL, starting the installation would look as follows:
        </p>
        <code class="block">
curl -O <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shirakumo/radiance-bootstrap/master/bin/radiance-bootstrap.lisp">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shirakumo/radiance-bootstrap/master/bin/radiance-bootstrap.lisp</a><br/>
sbcl --script radiance-bootstrap.lisp
        </code>
        <p>
          The bootstrapper will take care of seting up a Radiance distribution for you in a directory of your choice. Once it is done, you can download and extract the source files of the applications you want to use to their own subdirectories in <code>modules/</code>. Then simply run the launcher file mentioned at the end of the bootstrap and you're all set.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might also want to read <a href="https://github.com/Shirakumo/radiance-tutorial/blob/master/Part%207.md">Part 7</a> of the in-depth tutorial, which explains the setup process in a bit more detail.
